Instructions:
1. Upload file into Raw_images
2. Run bash ./pailitao file_name
3. Result will be saved in dir: Fetched_images/file_name

BTW: To avoid login process, one image will be treated as multiple urls.
     You can adjust #Attemps in Qiniu_interface.py by change #loop, 10 times default.

HINT:Rerun bash command usually better than just increase #Attemps
